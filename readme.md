SMS Sound test
==============

This repository contains a commented disassembly of SMS Sound Test by Nicolas Warren (Heliophobe) in 2001.

The v1.1 tag assembles byte-identical to the released ROM.

Later commits add some bug fixes.

Version 1.2:

- Fixed issue causing noise shift register to be reset on every frame
- Fixed incorrect labelling of white vs. synchronous noise mode
